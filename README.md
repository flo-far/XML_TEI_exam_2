## IV. AI usage.

As my letters were taken from a book, i tried to use AI to transcript automatically pictures of the pages. As the result was criticaly defective, with the AI inventing most of the parts, I prefered to use a traditional OCER transcript software and correct the result by myself. I sometime used AI to explain me some errors I couldn't understand, with more or less fortune.
